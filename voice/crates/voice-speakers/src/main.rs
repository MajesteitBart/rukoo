//! `rukoo-voice-speakers`: turns call audio into speaker frame probabilities with NeMo-Speech.cpp,
//! in a process of its own, so a crash in the native runtime never takes the app down.
//!
//! The app's speaker client (voice-core `speakers::client`) starts one worker per labelled
//! meeting stream, in its kill-on-close job and at below-normal priority. The worker only runs
//! NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Diarization; turning the probabilities into speaker turns and stable `call-N`
//! ids happens in the app. It reads the runtime folder and the model file it is given and writes
//! nothing to disk.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! The framing is voice-local's: one JSON request per line on stdin, a request that names `bytes`
//! followed by that many raw bytes, one JSON line per request on stdout in order, except `quit`.
//! Logs and the runtime's own output go to stderr. The worker exits 0 on `quit` and when stdin
//! closes.
//!
//! | Request | Response |
//! |---|---|
//! | `{"op":"ping","id":1}` | `{"id":1,"ok":true,"pid":4242,"version":"0.1.0","cpu":{"avx2":true,"fma":true,"f16c":true,"bmi2":true}}` |
//! | `{"op":"load","id":2,"runtime":"C:\\…\\nemo_speech","model":"C:\\…\\Nemotron-3-Diarization.q8_0.gguf","preset":"v3-streaming","chunkFrames":38,"rightContextFrames":1}` | `{"id":2,"ok":true,"speakers":8,"secondsPerFrame":0.01,"loadMs":812,"runtimeVersion":"…"}` |
//! | `{"op":"open","id":3}` | `{"id":3,"ok":true}` |
//! | `{"op":"push","id":4,"rate":16000,"bytes":32000}` + 32000 bytes of s16le mono | `{"id":4,"ok":true,"first":0,"frames":304,"count":304,"probs":"<base64>"}` |
//! | `{"op":"finish","id":5}` | the shape of `push`, with the frames the tail produced |
//! | `{"op":"close","id":6}` | `{"id":6,"ok":true}` |
//! | `{"op":"quit"}` | exits 0 |
//!
//! - `load` is valid once per process; a failed one may be repeated. `preset`, `chunkFrames` and
//!   `rightContextFrames` are optional and default to the live geometry above (0 keeps the
//!   preset's value). `runtimeVersion` is there when the runtime exports its version.
//! - `open` closes any previous stream. `rate` is optional and must be 16000. A push carries at
//!   most 10 s of audio.
//! - `probs` is base64 of `frames × speakers` little-endian f32 values, frame-major, for frames
//!   `first` to `first + frames`. `first` continues the previous reply's `count`, which is the
//!   stream's frame count after the call.
//! - A failure is `{"ok":false,"kind":…,"error":"<English message>"}` with `kind` one of
//!   `bad_request`, `cpu` (the processor lacks AVX2, FMA, F16C or BMI2; nothing was loaded),
//!   `runtime` (the folder, the DLL or an export is missing, or the DLL didn't load), `model` (the
//!   runtime refused the model), `not_open` (`push` or `finish` without an open stream),
//!   `behind` (the runtime dropped frames the worker hadn't returned) or `failed`. `error`
//!   carries `nemo_speech_asr_last_error()` when the runtime gave one.
//!
//! `--self-test --runtime <dir> --model <gguf> --wav <16 kHz mono wav> [--report <json>]` labels
//! the file in 1 s pushes and prints `{"speakers":n,"frames":f,"segments":s,"loadMs":l,
//! "realtimeFactor":r}`, with `speakers` counted from the runtime's own segments. `--version`
//! prints the version.

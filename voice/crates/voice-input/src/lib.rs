//! Input for Rukoo Voice dictation on Windows: push-to-talk hotkeys, text
//! insertion, selection capture and the focused window.
//!
//! Other platforms compile and return [`InputError::Unsupported`]; the
//! platform-neutral parts ([`HotkeyPoller::spawn_with`], [`PushToTalk`],
//! [`target::classify`]) work everywhere.
//!
//! The behavior ports Ownkey for Windows. Where Voice differs on purpose
//! (clipboard restore, Shift+Enter for newlines), the code says so.

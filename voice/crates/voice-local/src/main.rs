//! `rukoo-voice-local`: Rukoo Voice's local speech worker.
//!
//! The worker runs Orukeet (sherpa-onnx) in its own process, so a crashing or memory-hungry model
//! can't take dictation down, and unloading gives the memory back to the system. It only reads
//! the model folder it is given; it never downloads, hashes or writes model files.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! Requests arrive on stdin, one JSON object per line. A request that names `bytes` is followed by
//! exactly that many raw bytes. Every request gets one JSON line on stdout, in order; `quit` gets
//! none. Logs and sherpa-onnx's own output go to stderr. The worker exits 0 on `quit` and when
//! stdin closes.
//!
//! | Request | Response |
//! |---|---|
//! | `{"op":"ping"}` | `{"ok":true,"version":"0.1.0"}` |
//! | `{"op":"load","model":"orukeet","dir":"…","threads":4}` | `{"ok":true,"loadMs":1700}` |
//! | `{"op":"transcribe","id":7,"rate":16000,"bytes":n,"hotwords":["Bart"]}` + n bytes | `{"ok":true,"id":7,"text":"…","tokens":[…],"timestamps":[…],"durations":[…],"ms":450}` |
//! | `{"op":"unload"}` | `{"ok":true}` |
//! | `{"op":"quit"}` | exits 0 |
//!
//! - `threads` is optional (4). Loading the model that is already loaded answers `loadMs: 0`;
//!   loading another one unloads the first.
//! - `transcribe` takes 16 kHz mono s16le audio; `rate` is optional and must be 16000. Audio over
//!   15 s is cut at pauses and decoded window by window, as Ownkey does for dictation; send
//!   `"split": false` for audio the caller has already cut, such as meeting windows. Times are in
//!   seconds from the start of the audio. `hotwords` is optional.
//! - Any response may carry the request's `id`.
//! - A failure is `{"ok":false,"kind":…,"error":"<English message>"}` with `kind` one of
//!   `bad_request` (framing, unknown op or a bad field), `not_loaded` (transcribe before load),
//!   `missing_model` (folder or file absent), `bad_model` (files present but refused) or `failed`.
//! - A malformed line gets `bad_request` and the worker reads on. A request whose `bytes` is
//!   unusable can't be skipped exactly, so what follows is read as lines until one parses.
//! - sherpa-onnx ends the process on some damaged models instead of returning an error. The worker
//!   checks for the ones known to do that (`tokens.txt`, `bpe.vocab` and the encoder's metadata)
//!   before loading. If it still dies during a load, stderr holds sherpa-onnx's reason.

//! Follows one meeting while it records and afterwards, until every recorded second is
//! transcribed, and sends every meeting event to the event log.
//!
//! The recorder writes the audio and the timeline; the pipeline only reads them. It can stop,
//! crash or wait for consent at any moment without costing audio: its progress lives in
//! `transcript.db`, and a pipeline started again later continues from there. Each event has a key
//! that `transcript.db` keeps once the event is in the log, and at start the keys are checked
//! against the log itself, so nothing is sent twice, even after a crash between the two writes.
//!
//! With speaker labels, the call track has its own follower thread that stores who spoke when
//! (`speakers/`). The pipeline then cuts call windows only up to the follower's settled position,
//! splits a window's words by speaker before it commits them, and later names passages it had to
//! commit without a speaker.

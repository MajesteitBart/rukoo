// Windows and macOS. Everything it starts lives under tmp/live/<time>/ in this checkout: Voice's data folder
// (RUKOO_VOICE_DATA_DIR), Rukoo's profile (SEM_DATA_DIR), the discovery file both get as RUKOO_VOICE_BRIDGE, and the
// speech. Captures of the apps' own windows go to tmp/live-shots/. --models seeds the run's data folder with a models
// root in Voice's layout (<root>/orukeet/<revision>) without another copy: an APFS clone on macOS, a hard link
// elsewhere, a copy as the last resort. Without --models it uses tmp/voice-assets/models in this checkout when that
// holds Orukeet, so a Mac run transcribes; Windows still reads Ownkey's model folder when it isn't given one. Nothing
// touches the installed apps, the clipboard or the keyboard, nothing plays out loud, and every process it started is
// stopped by its process id. Cargo builds into CARGO_TARGET_DIR when it is set, else voice/target, and the programs
// run from there: debug builds unless --release is given, release builds for --measure=screen. Rukoo's MCP server
// listens on port 47810, not the 47800 an installed Rukoo uses.
//
// On macOS the default run is --screen off, because the macOS screen process doesn't record yet: --screen frames or
// video, --real-screen, --choose-monitor, --visible-rukoo, --measure and --sync refuse with a message that says what
// they would need. The speech comes from `say` with two installed English voices (the SAPI path stays on Windows). The
// screen process, window-protection, WebView2 capture and video checks are skipped, each with a line in the report that
// says why. --speakers is decided by Voice: when its Settings > Speaker labels reports reason "platform" the run
// refuses with that message, and on a build where the macOS speaker worker exists it runs with --nemo-dir (or
// tmp/voice-assets/nemo-arm64/nemo_speech) and the AMI excerpt and Nemotron from tmp/voice-assets/speaker-assets.
// A run without a model or a provider key still reports that as its one failed prerequisite and skips the passage
// checks: the script seeds a model but never downloads one and never uses a key.
//
// The checks: passages with the expected words reach Rukoo on both tracks before the stop; the pill shows the
// recording; Rukoo's windows are protected from capture; frames with their text reach Rukoo while it records and
// Rukoo gets their images; a killed screen process comes back with a screen gap and no gap in the audio; Voice
// restarted mid-meeting reattaches to the recorder and the screen process and sends no passage twice; a killed
// recorder comes back through the watchdog with a gap mark; the video files hold 1 to 2 s fragments; the stop goes to
// processing, then done, after the screen journal's stop; Rukoo's meeting.get has every passage Voice has; and a
// meeting started from Voice shows up in Rukoo with Voice's default screen mode. The report is
// tmp\live\<time>\report.json: counts, timings and which demo strings matched, never the text read from a frame.
//
// The screen. --screen sets Voice's default (meetings_screen in the dev config.json, default frames); the meeting
// started from Rukoo uses it, and one more short meeting from Rukoo asks for video explicitly. By default the screen
// process draws numbered slides ("Slide 1", "Slide 2" ...) itself (RUKOO_VOICE_TEST_SCREEN) and captures nothing of
// the desktop. --real-screen captures the real displays: a second Electron app puts a demo slide window on one display
// and an always-on-top demo cover on every other, RUKOO_VOICE_TEST_MONITOR pins the slide display, and a run whose
// first monitor isn't that display stops, deletes the meeting's screen folder and fails. Toasts and other apps' pop-ups
// can still draw above the demo windows, so a real-screen run keeps its captures in tmp\, takes no captures of the
// meeting view and deletes Voice's data folder and Rukoo's profile when it ends. Run it only when nobody uses the
// desktop.
//
//   --choose-monitor=<id>  (needs --real-screen) the slide window on <id> is a normal window that gets the focus, no
//                          monitor is pinned, and the run checks that Voice chose <id>, then switches from the pill and
//                          from Rukoo's header.
//   --visible-rukoo        (needs --real-screen) Rukoo's window sits over half the slide; two meetings from Voice,
//                          with Rukoo's hide-from-capture switch off (its demo strings must show in the first frame)
//                          and on (they must not, and the frame must show the slide where Rukoo's window is).
//   --measure=screen       (Windows) CPU and GPU of Voice's processes in four 10-minute meetings with live
//                          transcription, sampled by measure.ps1; release build. --seconds=<n> shortens each meeting for
//                          a trial. On the synthetic screen by default, at the sizes of this computer's displays as
//                          Windows reports them (off, frames and video at the main display's size, then video at the
//                          other display's size), with a new slide every 10 s; nothing shows on the desktop. With
//                          --real-screen, on the demo slide display instead: slides every 10 s, then a scrolling page,
//                          then still. Live speaker labels are off, so the screen's cost stands alone; with --speakers
//                          they are on, the call is the AMI excerpt and the speaker worker is measured too, for the
//                          combined load.
//
// --speakers plays the AMI meeting excerpt (fetched by scripts/speaker-assets.ps1 into tmp/speaker-assets, never
// committed) as the call, looped; the microphone keeps its SAPI speech. On top of the checks above: at least three
// call speakers reach Rukoo before the stop, and the three main AMI speakers get ids of their own; the id of MEE071
// gets a name; the speaker worker is killed and its voice keeps that id afterwards, and again after the Voice
// restart; after done at least 90% of the call's passage time went to the right speaker
// (scripts/lib/speaker-score.mjs) and no passage moved from one id to another between revisions. It doesn't combine
// with --real-screen, whose slides follow the SAPI call. `--nemo-dir` names the NeMo-Speech.cpp runtime (else
// RUKOO_VOICE_NEMO_DIR, else the shared folder, else Voice's lookup), and the AMI excerpt and Nemotron come from the
// shared speaker-assets folder. When Voice reports speaker labels unavailable for the platform (Settings' reason
// "platform"), the run refuses instead of recording a meeting without labels.
//
// --speakers=cpu|runtime|model runs a short meeting with RUKOO_VOICE_TEST_NO_SPEAKERS set to that reason: the call
// is one speaker, call-1, Settings > Speaker labels says why, and Voice captures that page.
//
// --models <dir> seeds each fresh Voice data folder from a models root in Voice's layout (<root>/orukeet/<revision>):
// an APFS clone with cp -c on macOS, a hard link or a copy elsewhere, so the model costs no second 487 MB and Voice
// finds it, hashes it once and keeps its stamp, as after an install. It defaults to tmp/voice-assets/models in this
// checkout when that holds Orukeet, on every platform. The run never downloads a model; --models points at one
// fetched once, for example with Voice's own Settings > Transcription code.
//
// --nemo-dir <dir> is the NeMo-Speech.cpp runtime folder for --speakers (a local macOS arm64 build, for instance); it
// becomes RUKOO_VOICE_NEMO_DIR for Voice. Without it tmp/voice-assets/nemo-arm64/nemo_speech is used when it holds a
// runtime.
//
// --measure=speakers measures labels on and off (spec RUK-109 section 7): the worker's real-time factor through its
// --self-test, then two meetings started from Voice in fresh data folders, labels on and labels off, each --minutes
// long (default 5) with CPU per process read by pid at minute 1 and 5 (and at the end of a longer one), the speaker
// worker's peak working set, and the call passages' latency. With --minutes of 21 or more the labels-on meeting is
// also the compaction run: the settled position keeps moving past minute 20, the worker never restarts, and the three
// main speakers keep their ids from the first five minutes to the last five.
//
// The runtime: RUKOO_VOICE_NEMO_DIR when set; otherwise tmp\speaker-assets\nemo_speech when it holds one; otherwise
// Voice's own order (next to the exe, then Ownkey's copy, read only).
//
// --sync adds bucket sync against voice-s3-fake (rukoo-voice-fake-s3) in tmp\live\<time>\s3\: Voice connects
// through its Settings commands before the meeting; audio objects arrive while it records, and frames too when the
// meeting records the screen; the fake stops for 20 s mid-meeting and the recorder's heartbeats stay within 1,300 ms;
// the Voice restart leaves no object uploaded twice; video goes up only after the stop; after done every object passes
// check-encrypted.mjs, the clips and screen.json never went up, and neither the secret nor the recovery code is in
// plain text; an agent's audio link (get_meeting_media_link) gives the meeting's speech and is refused after its 5 s,
// and its frame and video links give the screen; and a second Voice on a fresh data folder imports the code, restores
// every meeting into Rukoo with its screen journal and speaker ids, and serves the same audio, frame and video from
// the bucket. It combines with --screen and --speakers, never with --real-screen. --measure=sync adds spec-RUK-110's
// measurements to report.json: a 10-minute meeting with sync on, a 3-minute one with sync off and six short ones.
// --remote-fetch=<ssh target> lets that machine, on the tailnet, call the tool over Rukoo's Tailscale listener and
// download the link with curl, read only; it then checks that the link is refused from this computer's own address
// and after it expired. The recovery code and the secret stay in memory.

# Rukoo account protocol, version 1

A Rukoo account syncs small pieces of Rukoo's own data between a person's devices: inbox categories, the category each email got, and corrections. Mail, passwords and Google tokens never go through it. Everything the account stores is encrypted on the device with a key the server never sees.

This document is the contract between the server in this folder, Rukoo for desktop (`src/main/account/`) and Rukoo for Android. A change here needs the same change in all three.

## Encoding

- Binary values in JSON are base64url without padding (RFC 4648 §5).
- Text is UTF-8. Passwords are normalized to Unicode NFC before use.
- An email address is normalized by trimming spaces and lowercasing the whole address.
- Times are milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

## Keys

All key derivation happens on the device.

| Name | How it is made |
|---|---|
| `masterKey` | Argon2id (version 0x13) of the password, with the account's 16-byte `salt` and its `kdf` parameters, 32 bytes out |
| `authKey` | `HKDF(masterKey, "rukoo/v1/auth\n" + server)` |
| `wrapKey` | `HKDF(masterKey, "rukoo/v1/wrap")` |
| `dataKey` | 32 random bytes, made once at sign-up; it never changes |
| `recordKey` | `HKDF(dataKey, "rukoo/v1/records")` |
| `indexKey` | `HKDF(dataKey, "rukoo/v1/index")` |
| `recoveryKey` | 20 random bytes, made at sign-up and shown to the person once |
| `recoveryAuth` | `HKDF(recoveryKey, "rukoo/v1/recovery-auth\n" + server)` |
| `recoveryWrap` | `HKDF(recoveryKey, "rukoo/v1/recovery-wrap")` |

`server` is the server's address as the device uses it: scheme, host, port only when it isn't the default one, and path, without a trailing slash, in lowercase apart from the path, such as `https://rukoo.io`. With it in `authKey` and `recoveryAuth`, a proof made for one server is no good at another. A server someone was tricked into using can't pass a person's sign-in on to their real server. The other side of this: an account belongs to the address it was made at, so a server that moves to another address has to keep answering at the old one.

`HKDF(ikm, info)` is HKDF-SHA256 (RFC 5869) with an empty salt, which gives the same keys as a salt of 32 zero bytes, and 32 bytes of output. `info` is the label's UTF-8 bytes.

The `kdf` parameters are `{ "alg": "argon2id", "m": 65536, "t": 3, "p": 1 }` for new accounts: 64 MiB of memory (`m` in KiB), 3 passes, 1 lane. A device refuses parameters weaker than `m` 19456 or `t` 2 when signing in, so a server can't talk it into a cheaper hash of the password. It also refuses more than `m` 1048576, `t` 10 or `p` 4, and a phone refuses what it can't spare: the Android app runs at most 256 MiB, never more than half of its memory, and `m` × `t` of at most 1048576.

The recovery key is written in Crockford base32 (`0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ`), 32 characters in eight groups of four: `7K2M-9QXD-…`. When it is read back, letters are uppercased, `O` reads as `0`, `I` and `L` as `1`, and dashes and spaces are ignored.

### Sealing

`seal(key, plaintext, aad)` is AES-256-GCM with a random 12-byte nonce and a 16-byte tag. Its output is one version byte `0x01`, the nonce, the ciphertext and the tag, in that order. `open` refuses any other version byte and any tag that doesn't verify.

- `wrappedKey = seal(wrapKey, dataKey, "rukoo/v1/data-key")`
- `recoveryWrappedKey = seal(recoveryWrap, dataKey, "rukoo/v1/data-key")`

### What the server stores to check a sign-in

The server keeps `SHA-256(authKey)` and `SHA-256(recoveryAuth)`, never the keys themselves. `authKey` is already the output of Argon2id, so a stolen database still costs an attacker one Argon2id run per password guess.

## Records

Everything the account syncs is a record: a value in a collection under a key.

```json
{ "c": "category", "k": "needs-you", "v": { "name": "Needs you" }, "t": 1793000000000 }
```

- `c` is the collection, `k` the record's key in it, `v` any JSON value and `t` when the device changed it. A deleted record has `v` null and `d` true.
- The record's id is `base64url(HMAC-SHA256(indexKey, c + "\n" + k))`, 43 characters. The server can match a record to its id, but not learn the collection or the key.
- The record's `data` is `seal(recordKey, JSON of the record, "rukoo/v1/record:" + id)`. Binding the id into the tag stops the server from swapping the contents of two records.
- A device deletes a record by writing it again with `d` true, sealed like any other. The deletion then carries its time and settles against changes on other devices like any write. The server also knows deletion without contents (`data` null, a tombstone), but devices don't act on one: nothing in it proves a device of the account wrote it, so a server could use it to erase records. Only a sealed deletion deletes.

A device that opens a record checks that its `c` and `k` give the id it arrived under, and drops it otherwise.

### When two devices change the same record

The server keeps whatever reaches it last, so devices settle the order themselves. A device that receives a record it has a newer version of keeps its own and sends it again. Newer means a later `t`; on equal `t`, the larger JSON text of `[d ? 1 : 0, v]`, so every device picks the same one. Records written with `ifAbsent` (a first write) are the exception: the server keeps the first one it got, and a device takes that one whatever the times say.

### Collections

| Collection | Key | Value | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `category` | the category's id | `{ name, description, color, order, inbox }`; `inbox` false keeps the category's mail out of Inbox itself, and a value without it is shown | last write wins |
| `classification` | account email + `"\n"` + the email's Message-ID; `"m:"` + its SHA-256 hex when it is longer than 256 characters; or `"h:"` + SHA-256 hex of sender, date and subject when it has none | `{ category, source, confidence, model, at }` | first write wins (`ifAbsent`) |
| `override` | the same key as `classification` | `{ category, at }` | last write wins |
| `sender` | a lowercased sender address | `{ category, at }` | last write wins |
| `setting` | a setting's name, such as `categories` | that setting's value, such as `{ enabled, unsure, seeded }` | last write wins |
| `booking` | `settings:<acct>`, the booking page's settings; `map:<acct>:<bookingId>`, which event a booking became | see [Booking pages](#booking-pages) | last write wins |
| `bookingkey` | `<acct>` | the booking page's key pair: `{ current, keys: { <keyId>: { privatePkcs8, publicRaw, createdAt } } }` | first write wins (`ifAbsent`) |

`<acct>` is the first 16 characters of `base64url(SHA-256(the account's normalized email))`, so a device that signs in to another account never uses these records. A device leaves `bookingkey` out of "Export my data" and removes it locally when it signs out.

A device ignores collections it doesn't know, so a newer app can add one without breaking older ones.

## HTTP API

The server speaks JSON over HTTPS. Requests that need a session send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Devices send `Accept-Encoding: identity` and refuse an answer with any other `Content-Encoding`, so a device counts a body toward its limits as the server sent it, not as it unpacks. Errors come back as `{ "error": "<code>", "message": "<text>" }` with the status below.

| Status | `error` |
|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid` (the request's shape or values are wrong) |
| 401 | `unauthorized` (no session or an ended session; on `login` and `recover/*`, a wrong password or recovery key) |
| 403 | `signups_closed` (also when the server holds as many accounts as it takes), `invite_required` (also for a code that has been used up), `wrong_password` (a signed-in request whose `authKey` doesn't match) |
| 404 | `not_found` |
| 409 | `exists` (sign-up for an address that has an account) |
| 413 | `too_large`, `quota` |
| 429 | `locked` (too many failed sign-ins), `rate_limited` |
| 500 | `not_configured` (the server has no `PEPPER` secret), `server` |

### `GET /v1/info`

Who runs this server and where it keeps data. No session needed. The app shows this before sign-up.

```json
{
  "protocol": 1,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "operator": { "name": "…", "url": "…", "contact": "…", "privacy": "…" },
  "hosting": { "provider": "Cloudflare", "company": "Cloudflare, Inc.", "country": "US", "jurisdiction": "eu" },
  "signups": "open",
  "limits": { "records": 250000, "bytes": 104857600, "recordBytes": 16384, "batch": 500 },
  "features": ["booking"]
}
```

`jurisdiction` is `eu`, `us`, `fedramp` or null: where the account's storage lives and runs. `signups` is `open`, `invite` or `closed`. `features` lists the optional parts of this protocol the server offers; `booking` means [Booking pages](#booking-pages). A server without it answers 404 on those routes, and a device hides the feature. The protocol version stays 1.

### `POST /v1/prelogin`

`{ "email" }` → `{ "kdf", "salt" }`. For an address without an account the server returns the default `kdf` and a salt made from its secret and the address, the same each time, so this call doesn't tell anyone whether an account exists.

### `POST /v1/signup`

```json
{
  "email": "…", "invite": "…",
  "kdf": { … }, "salt": "…", "authKey": "…", "wrappedKey": "…",
  "recoveryAuth": "…", "recoveryWrappedKey": "…",
  "device": { "name": "Bart's desktop", "platform": "linux" }
}
```

→ `201 { "token", "account" }`, where `account` is what `GET /v1/account` returns. `invite` is needed only when `signups` is `invite`.

### `POST /v1/login`

`{ "email", "authKey", "device" }` → `{ "token", "wrappedKey", "account" }`.

Ten failed attempts on one account within 15 minutes of the first lock it for 15 minutes. The tenth attempt already gets `429 locked`, and so does every attempt during the lock, also with the right password. A successful attempt resets the count. Every 429 carries `Retry-After` in seconds. Apart from this lock, a server may limit how often one network address calls `prelogin`, `signup`, `login`, `recover/*` and `POST /v1/records` (`429 rate_limited`).

An account keeps at most 100 sessions; a new one past that ends the session seen longest ago.

### `POST /v1/logout`

Ends this session. → `204`.

### `GET /v1/account`

```json
{
  "email": "…", "createdAt": 0, "kdf": { … },
  "usage": { "records": 0, "bytes": 0 },
  "limits": { … },
  "devices": [{ "id": "…", "name": "…", "platform": "…", "createdAt": 0, "lastSeenAt": 0, "current": true }]
}
```

### `DELETE /v1/devices/:id`

Signs that device out. → `204`.

### `POST /v1/password`

This call, `POST /v1/recovery` and `DELETE /v1/account` check the password again with `authKey`. A wrong one gives `403 wrong_password`, never 401, so the device can tell a typo from a session that ended. These attempts count toward the same lock as sign-ins.


`{ "authKey", "kdf", "salt", "newAuthKey", "wrappedKey" }`, where `authKey` proves the current password and `wrappedKey` is the data key wrapped with the new one. Signs out every other device. → `204`.

### `POST /v1/recovery`

`{ "authKey", "recoveryAuth", "recoveryWrappedKey" }`: replaces the recovery key. → `204`.

### `POST /v1/recover/start` and `POST /v1/recover/finish`

For a forgotten password. `start` takes `{ "email", "recoveryAuth" }` and returns `{ "recoveryWrappedKey", "kdf" }`. `finish` takes `{ "email", "recoveryAuth", "kdf", "salt", "authKey", "wrappedKey", "device" }`, sets the new password, signs out every device and returns `{ "token", "account" }`. Failed attempts count toward the same lock as sign-ins.

### `DELETE /v1/account`

`{ "authKey", "handleKey" }` → `204`. Deletes the account and every record at once. `handleKey` is optional: 32 random bytes in base64url that the deleting device makes and keeps. The account's booking page is wiped, and its handle stays reserved for 12 months for whoever sends that key as `reclaim` with `PUT /v1/booking`; without it, for nobody. Sign-ups don't prove the address, so a new account with the same email gets the handle only with the key.

### `GET /v1/records?since=<seq>&limit=<n>`

Records changed after `since`, oldest first, at most `limit` (default and maximum 1000; a larger `limit` counts as 1000). A page also ends early once it holds about 4 MiB, with `more` true.

```json
{ "records": [{ "id": "…", "seq": 12, "data": "…" }], "seq": 40, "more": true }
```

`seq` is the newest change on the server. Keep asking with the last record's `seq` while `more` is true.

A device checks each page: every record's `seq` comes after `since`, in rising order, and not past `seq`, and every `id` is 43 characters of base64url. It refuses a page that doesn't, without moving its cursor. When `seq` is lower than the device's cursor, the server lost changes or an earlier answer was false; the device starts again from `since=0`. A pull stops asking for more after 500 pages, or once 256 MiB of answers have come in, counting every byte of each response body rather than only `data`. The device checks between pages, so the page that crosses 256 MiB is the last one taken. A page with more records than the device asked for is refused. What is left comes with the next sync, so a server can't keep a device busy.

### `POST /v1/records`

```json
{ "records": [{ "id": "…", "data": "…", "ifAbsent": true }] }
```

At most 500 records per request (`413 too_large` above that), each `data` at most 16 KiB once decoded. A device keeps a record that would be larger to itself rather than send it, since it would fail the whole push. `data` null deletes the record. With `ifAbsent` the record is stored only when the server has no live record under that id. A push is stored whole or not at all.

Every stored write gets the next `seq`, also a delete. A tombstone stays so devices that pull later learn of the delete. Deleting what is already deleted, or was never stored, changes nothing: the result says `stored` true with the current `seq`, and no row is made. A push that would take the account past `limits.records` live records, `limits.bytes`, or `limits.records` tombstones gets `413 quota`, unless it makes an account that is already over a limit smaller.

→ `{ "results": [{ "id": "…", "seq": 41, "stored": true }], "seq": 41 }`. A record that wasn't stored comes back with the `seq` of the one the server kept; the device fetches that one on its next pull.

## What the server can see

- The account's email address, when it was made and the `kdf` parameters.
- Device names and platforms, and when each device last connected.
- How many records there are, their sizes and when they change.
- IP addresses, in Cloudflare's request logs and in the rate limiter.
- For an account that turns on a booking page: what that page publishes and the bookings made on it, as [Booking pages](#booking-pages) describes.

It can't see what a record holds: no category names, no senders, no Message-IDs and nothing about the mail.

## What can't be recovered

The server can't reset a password: it never has the key. A forgotten password plus a lost recovery key means the account's records are gone. Rukoo can sort the mail again, but corrections and custom categories are lost.

## Booking pages

A booking page lets other people, and their AI assistants, book time with an account holder at `<BOOKING_ORIGIN>/<handle>`, or at `/meet/<handle>` on a server without `BOOKING_ORIGIN` (see [Where public routes live](#where-public-routes-live)). It is off until the account holder turns it on, and turning it on changes what the server sees: unlike records, a booking page's open times, its texts and the bookings made on it are readable by the server, because the server has to offer times and take bookings while the host's computers are off.

Only the host's Rukoo on one computer, the booking device, talks to mail and calendar providers. The server never holds provider tokens or passwords and never sends mail. It offers times from what the booking device published, takes bookings, and keeps each guest's name, email, notes and assistant name sealed to a key only the host's devices hold. The server reads those details once, at booking time, to seal them; after that a copy of its storage doesn't reveal them. The operator, or a server that was broken into, can still read new bookings as they arrive.

Owner routes are under `/v1/booking`, need a session and use the same JSON style as the rest of this document: camelCase, times in milliseconds. Public routes are at the root of `BOOKING_ORIGIN` or under `/meet`, need no session and use snake_case with ISO 8601 times. No GET or HEAD request changes anything on either side.

### Handles and meeting types

- A handle is 3 to 32 characters: lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens inside, `^[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9]|-(?=[a-z0-9])){2,31}$`. Paths match it exactly; `/Bart` is a 404.
- Reserved handles: `api`, `assets`, `v1`, `meet`, `mcp`, `llms`, `admin`, `help`, `privacy`, `rukoo`, `www`, `mail`, `support`, `account`, `settings`, `login`, `signup`, `book`, `booking`, `bookings`, `cal`, `calendar`, `openapi`, `well-known`, `static`, `abuse`, `security`, `status`, `operator`, `bvdm`, plus whatever the operator lists in `BLOCKED_HANDLES`. Because pages can share the root of an address with a website (rukoo.io does), the website's paths and likely future ones are reserved too: `img`, `media`, `download`, `downloads`, `github`, `releases`, `styles`, `app`, `film`, `video`, `docs`, `blog`, `about`, `pricing`, `features`, `terms`, `legal`, `press`, `contact`, `changelog`, `android`, `windows`, `mac`, `linux`, `robots`, `sitemap`, `favicon`, `index`, `booker`.
- An account has at most one handle and can change it at most 3 times in 30 days.
- A handle that is given up (renamed, turned off, or its account deleted) stays reserved for that account for 12 months, then becomes free. After a deletion, "that account" means whoever brings the deleting device's `handleKey` (see `DELETE /v1/account`); a page whose account disappeared otherwise is reserved for nobody. A renamed handle redirects to the new one with 301 for 180 days. A rename is refused while the old handle has bookings in the future, or a future booking has a change the booking device hasn't handled yet (a guest's cancellation): after the rename it only reads the new handle.
- A meeting type's slug is 1 to 40 characters with the same character rules, unique on its page, and none of `api`, `mcp`, `booking`, `bookings`, `llms`, `openapi`, `ics`, `assets`, `manage`, `prepare`.

### One booking device

The device that turns the page on handles it: it publishes open times and processes bookings. The page stores that device's session id. A publish or a booking action from another session of the same account gets `409 other_device`, unless a `PUT /v1/booking` carries `takeover: true`, which makes the caller the booking device. Other devices can read the page and its bookings. `DELETE /v1/booking` works from any session of the account, so turning the page off and deleting the account always work. There are no claims or leases beyond this.

A page turned off from another session has no booking device, but the device that had it doesn't know yet and may still publish what it had, which would turn the page back on. So until that device's session reads `GET /v1/booking`, its `PUT /v1/booking` without `takeover`, a rename included, gets `409 other_device`. Reading the page clears this; the device then knows the page is off, and turning it on again is its user's choice. A `takeover: true` publish always goes through. The device that turned the page off itself, any other session, and a new session on the same computer (a new sign-in) publish as usual.

### Owner errors

| Status | `error` |
|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid`, with `field` naming the first field that was refused |
| 401 | `unauthorized`, only for a missing or ended session |
| 404 | `not_found`: no such booking |
| 409 | `handle_taken`, `handle_reserved`, `handle_lost` (the page's handle no longer belongs to this account), `handle_changes` (more than 3 in 30 days), `has_bookings` (a rename while future bookings exist, or a change to one, such as a guest's cancellation, isn't handled yet), `other_device`, `slot_taken`, `stale_version`, `not_active` (a cancel of a booking that is over) |
| 413 | `too_large` |

None of these routes answers 401 for anything but the session itself, so a device never mistakes a lost handle for being signed out. A `409 stale_version` carries the booking as it is now: `{ "error": "stale_version", "message": "…", "booking": { … } }`. A `409 slot_taken` carries up to 3 `alternatives` as start times in milliseconds.

### `GET /v1/booking`

The account's booking page.

```json
{
  "handle": "bart",
  "url": "https://meet.example/bart",
  "base": "https://meet.example",
  "enabled": true,
  "device": { "id": "q8Zr3mXwT0aYbC1dEfGh2i", "name": "Bart's desktop", "current": true },
  "publishedAt": 1793000000000,
  "keyId": "8hJk2sQpX1c",
  "seq": 41,
  "pending": 1,
  "upcoming": 4,
  "today": { "bookings": 2, "cap": 20, "mail": 3, "mailMax": 10 },
  "handleChanges": { "used": 1, "max": 3 }
}
```

- `url` is the page's public address: `BOOKING_ORIGIN` plus `/<handle>` when the operator set one (the example), else the server's own origin plus `/meet/<handle>`. Devices take it from here and never build it themselves.
- `base` is what every page address on this server starts with, without a trailing slash: `BOOKING_ORIGIN`, else the server's own origin plus `/meet`. It is there before the account has a handle, so a device can show where a new page will live.
- `device` is the booking device; `name` is null when that session has ended, and `current` says whether it is the caller.
- `publishedAt` is the last publish; `keyId` the key that guest details are sealed to now.
- `seq` is the newest change to the page's bookings (see `GET /v1/booking/bookings`).
- `today` counts the host's local day: new bookings against the daily cap, and invitation-causing changes against the mail budget.

An account without a handle gets `{ "handle": null, "url": null, "base": "https://meet.example", "enabled": false, "device": null, "publishedAt": null, "keyId": null, "seq": 0, "pending": 0, "upcoming": 0, "today": null, "handleChanges": { "used": 0, "max": 3 } }`. A handle this account kept while the page is off has `enabled` false and the same `handle`.

### `PUT /v1/booking`

Claims the handle if needed, publishes and turns the page on or off. The whole page is sent each time.

```json
{
  "handle": "bart",
  "enabled": true,
  "takeover": false,
  "profile": {
    "name": "Bart van der Meeren",
    "intro": "Happy to talk about agents in your team.",
    "timeZone": "Europe/Amsterdam",
    "locale": "en",
    "keyId": "8hJk2sQpX1c",
    "publicKey": "BEl…87 characters",
    "contact": "No time that works? Reply to my last email.",
    "dailyCap": 20,
    "types": [
      {
        "slug": "30min",
        "title": "30 minute meeting",
        "duration": 30,
        "description": "",
        "location": { "kind": "googleMeet", "label": "Google Meet" },
        "bufferBefore": 0,
        "bufferAfter": 0,
        "minNotice": 240,
        "horizon": 30,
        "slotInterval": 30,
        "dailyLimit": null,
        "confirm": false,
        "hidden": false,
        "schedule": "default"
      }
    ]
  },
  "windows": { "default": [[1793692800000, 1793721600000], [1793779200000, 1793808000000]] },
  "busy": [[1793696400000, 1793700000000]]
}
```

→ what `GET /v1/booking` returns.

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `handle` | the handle rules above. A different handle than the account has renames the page (see Handles). |
| `enabled` | false keeps the page and its bookings but offers no times; the page says it isn't taking bookings and shows `contact` |
| `reclaim` | optional; the `handleKey` sent when the account that had this handle was deleted. With it, an account (usually the same person's, made again) takes the reserved handle over; a wrong one is `409 handle_reserved` |
| `profile` | at most 64 KiB as JSON |
| `name` | 1 to 100 characters |
| `intro` | at most 1000 |
| `timeZone` | an IANA zone the server's `Intl` knows |
| `locale` | `en` or `nl`, the page's default language |
| `keyId`, `publicKey` | base64url of 8 and 65 bytes; `keyId` is `SHA-256(publicKey)[0..8]`, `publicKey` an uncompressed P-256 point |
| `contact` | null or at most 200 characters |
| `dailyCap` | 1 to 50 new bookings per host-local day |
| `invites` | optional; `false` when the host's calendar sends guests no invitations (a demo calendar). Leave it out otherwise |
| `types` | 1 to 10 |
| `slug`, `title`, `duration` | slug rules; 1 to 100 characters; minutes, 5 to 480, a multiple of 5 |
| `description` | at most 500 |
| `location` | `kind` is `googleMeet`, `phone`, `inPerson`, `link` or `none`; `label` at most 100; `value` at most 500, and only when the host made it public. An empty `label` is shown as the kind's own name: from `booking-text.js` in the page's language (en, nl) on pages, in English ("Google Meet", "Phone call", "In person", "Link") in JSON, `llms.txt` and MCP. A `none` location with an empty label shows no location. |
| `bufferBefore`, `bufferAfter` | minutes, 0 to 240 |
| `minNotice` | minutes, 0 to 43200 |
| `horizon` | days, 1 to 90 |
| `slotInterval` | minutes, 5 to 480 |
| `dailyLimit` | null or 1 to 50 per host-local day |
| `confirm`, `hidden` | booleans: bookings of this type wait for the host; the type is left off the landing page, the API and MCP but can be booked by its link |
| `schedule` | the key in `windows` this type uses; `default` |
| `windows` | `{ "default": [[start, end], …] }`, at most 2000 intervals, sorted, not overlapping, from 1 day ago to 91 days ahead |
| `busy` | at most 5000 intervals, sorted, not overlapping, each edge a multiple of 15 minutes (900000 ms) |

`takeover: true` makes the caller the booking device. Without it, a publish from another session gets `409 other_device`; the first publish on a page sets the device, and so does the first one after the page was turned off, except from the former booking device before it has read the page ([One booking device](#one-booking-device)). A publish whose `keyId` differs from the last one is accepted: bookings already sealed keep their key id in the blob.

### `DELETE /v1/booking`

Turns the page off and deletes everything on it: the profile, open times, busy times and every booking. The handle stays reserved for this account (see Handles). → `204`. From another session than the booking device's, it also holds back that device's next publish until it has read the page ([One booking device](#one-booking-device)). An account without a handle also gets `204`, and so does one whose handle another account took after the reservation ran out: nothing of this account is on it. A device deletes the page first when the account is deleted, and stops if that fails; it skips this step on a server whose `/v1/info` doesn't list `booking` in `features`, and takes a `404` from a server without these routes as done. The server also wipes a page whose account no longer exists within two days (see Retention).

### `GET /v1/booking/handles/<handle>`

Whether this account can take a handle, for checking while the host types. Always `200` for a valid session:

```json
{ "handle": "bart", "available": false, "reason": "taken" }
```

`reason` is null when `available` is true, else `invalid`, `reserved`, `taken` or `yours` (the account already has it).

### `GET /v1/booking/bookings?since=<seq>&limit=<n>`

The page's bookings that changed after `since`, oldest change first, at most `limit` (default and maximum 500).

```json
{
  "bookings": [
    {
      "id": "Rf63vMqqWdS0MICDAHKmrw",
      "type": "30min",
      "start": 1793696400000,
      "end": 1793698200000,
      "status": "confirmed",
      "version": 1,
      "handledVersion": 0,
      "seq": 41,
      "sealed": "AjE3…",
      "channel": "api",
      "createdAt": 1793000000000,
      "updatedAt": 1793000000000,
      "expiresAt": null,
      "reschedules": 0,
      "uid": "Rf63vMqqWdS0MICDAHKmrw@meet.example",
      "notify": true,
      "cancelledBy": null,
      "reason": null,
      "message": null,
      "bookedStart": 1793696400000,
      "bookedEnd": 1793698200000
    }
  ],
  "seq": 41,
  "more": false
}
```

- `status` is `pending`, `confirmed`, `cancelled`, `declined` or `expired`. A pending request lapses to `expired` at `expiresAt`: 48 hours after it was made, or its start minus the type's minimum notice, whichever comes first. The server notices this lazily, on the next read, and the lapse counts as a change.
- `version` starts at 1 and rises with every change of status, time or type: confirm, decline, cancel, reschedule, lapse. A device processes every version after `handledVersion`.
- `seq` is the page's change counter. Every change that raises `version` takes the next `seq`. `handled` doesn't, so a device doesn't see its own bookkeeping again. Purging an old booking produces no row; a device forgets its own copy 30 days after the meeting.
- `sealed` is the guest's details (see Sealed guest details), null once the booking was cancelled, declined or lapsed.
- `channel` is `web`, `api` or `mcp`.
- `uid` is the booking's calendar UID: `<id>@<host of the page's url>`, fixed when the booking is made, so a later change of `BOOKING_ORIGIN` doesn't change it. The host's calendar event and the guest's `.ics` both use it; devices copy it and never work it out again. When the host's calendar gives the event another UID (Google may ignore the one a client sends), the booking device reports it with `handled` and `uid`, and from then on this field and the guest's `.ics` carry that one.
- `notify` says whether the host's calendar may send mail for this version (see Limits, Mail budget). It is true for a confirmation (a new confirmed booking, a guest's reschedule, the host's confirm) and for a guest's cancellation while the day's mail budget lasts, and false past it. A host confirm counts toward the budget but its `notify` is always true. Pending, declined and lapsed versions, and the host's own cancellations and reschedules, have `notify: false`: no invitation goes out for them, or the host's calendar already sent what the host chose.
- `cancelledBy` is `guest`, `host` or null; `reason` is null for a guest's cancellation, else what the host's device sent (`host_cancelled`, `host_deleted`, `guest_declined`); `message` is the host's message to the guest, at most 500 characters, shown on the guest's manage page.
- `bookedStart` and `bookedEnd` are the times the booking was made for, which the sealed details carry. A reschedule changes `start` and `end` but can't change the sealed details, which the server can't open.

Cursor rules are those of `GET /v1/records`: keep asking with the last booking's `seq` while `more` is true; a device refuses a page whose `seq` values aren't rising, after `since` and not past `seq`; when the answer's `seq` is lower than the device's cursor, the page was deleted or replaced and the device starts again from `since=0`. An account without a handle gets `{ "bookings": [], "seq": 0, "more": false }`.

### `POST /v1/booking/bookings/<id>`

A booking action from the booking device. `<id>` is 22 characters of base64url.

| `action` | Body | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `handled` | `{ "action": "handled", "version": 2, "uid": "3q5n8kb4o0b8j0q1k2r7c2a9vs@google.com" }` | Sets `handledVersion` to the larger of the two. `version` may not be above the current one. `uid` is optional: the UID the host's calendar gave the event, when it isn't the booking's own, 1 to 255 visible ASCII characters (`400 invalid`, field `uid`, otherwise). The server stores it as the booking's `uid`; like the rest of `handled` it doesn't advance the cursor. |
| `confirm` | `{ "action": "confirm", "version": 1 }` | `pending` → `confirmed`. |
| `decline` | `{ "action": "decline", "version": 1, "message": "…" }` | `pending` → `declined`; the slot is free again. `message` is optional. |
| `cancel` | `{ "action": "cancel", "version": 3, "reason": "host_deleted", "message": "…" }` | `pending` or `confirmed` → `cancelled`. `reason` is `host_cancelled`, `host_deleted` or `guest_declined`; `message` is optional. A booking whose meeting is over gets `409 not_active`, as a guest's cancellation does. |
| `reschedule` | `{ "action": "reschedule", "version": 3, "start": 1793703600000, "host": true }` | Moves the booking, keeping its length. With `host: true` the slot rules are skipped, for times the host set in their own calendar; without it the new time must be an open slot for the booking's own length (see Slots; `409 slot_taken` with `alternatives`). |

Every action except `handled` must name the current `version`; another one gets `409 stale_version` with the booking as it is. A booking that is no longer pending can't be confirmed or declined (`409 stale_version`), so a lapsed request stays lapsed. → `200 { "booking": { … } }` in the shape of `GET /v1/booking/bookings`.

### Sealed guest details

A guest's details are sealed to the page's public key the moment a booking is made.

1. The server makes an ephemeral P-256 key pair and takes the x-coordinate of the ECDH shared secret with the host's public key (`deriveBits`, 256 bits) as input key material.
2. `key = HKDF-SHA256(ikm, salt = ephemeralPublic ‖ ownerPublic, info = "rukoo/v1/booking-guest")`, 32 bytes. Both public keys are uncompressed points of 65 bytes.
3. The details are AES-256-GCM encrypted with a random 12-byte nonce and the additional data `"rukoo/v1/booking:" + handle + ":" + bookingId`.
4. `sealed = base64url(0x02 ‖ keyId (8) ‖ ephemeralPublic (65) ‖ nonce (12) ‖ ciphertext and tag (16))`, where `keyId = SHA-256(ownerPublic)[0..8]`.

The plaintext is UTF-8 JSON with exactly these keys, in this order:

```json
{ "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com", "notes": "Kickoff", "timeZone": "Europe/Amsterdam", "locale": "en", "via": "ChatGPT", "manageKey": "…43 characters", "type": "30min", "start": 1793696400000, "end": 1793698200000 }
```

`notes` and `via` are empty strings when the guest gave none; `start` and `end` are milliseconds. A device checks every field again after opening it (name at most 80 characters without control characters, notes at most 1000, a plain address, a known zone) and that `type` matches the booking's `type`, and `start` and `end` its `bookedStart` and `bookedEnd`. The server's tests and the desktop's share the vectors in `server/test/fixtures/booking-vectors.json`.

A booking id is 16 random bytes and a manage key 32 random bytes, both base64url. The server keeps only `SHA-256(manageKey)` and compares with a constant-time check. It clears the sealed details and any idempotency entry as soon as a booking is cancelled, declined or lapses. The key hash stays until the booking is purged, so the guest's manage link still shows what happened and the host's message.

### Slots

The server works out the open times; devices only publish windows and busy times.

- Candidates step by the type's `slotInterval` from local midnight on the host's wall clock in the profile's `timeZone`. A time a clock change skips isn't offered; of a time that happens twice, only the first counts.
- A candidate lies inside `windows[schedule]`, starts at least `minNotice` from now and less than `horizon` days ahead.
- The meeting widened by `bufferBefore` and `bufferAfter` overlaps neither `busy` nor any active booking widened by its own type's buffers. Pending requests hold their slot until they lapse. The booking being rescheduled doesn't count against itself.
- A booking keeps its length when it moves, also after the host changed its type's `duration`. A move, by the guest or by the host without `host: true`, is checked as the booking's type with the booking's own length (`end - start`) in place of `duration`; the buffers, `slotInterval`, `minNotice`, `horizon` and limits stay the type's. The times offered for a move (the booker with `reschedule`) and the `alternatives` of a refused move are worked out the same way. `GET /api/slots` lists times for a new booking, at the type's current `duration`, so a time from it can still be refused for a longer booking that moves there (`409 slot_taken`, with `alternatives` that fit it).
- The host-local day stays under the type's `dailyLimit` and the page's `dailyCap`.
- More than 24 hours (`BOOKING_STALE_HOURS`) after the last publish, every type acts as if it needs the host's confirmation, and a guest can't move a confirmed booking (`403 limit_reached`, `limit: "stale"`): its new time would only be checked against the same old busy times. More than 7 days (`BOOKING_DARK_DAYS`) after it, no times are offered: the page shows the text for "no open times", plus `contact`.

### Public routes

#### Where public routes live

The paths in this section are relative to the booking base, which depends on `BOOKING_ORIGIN`:

| `BOOKING_ORIGIN` | Booking base | Pages | MCP | Script and icons |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| set, such as `https://meet.rukoo.io` | its root | `https://meet.rukoo.io/<handle>…` | `/mcp` | `/booker.js`, `/favicon.svg`, … |
| empty (self-hosted servers, tests) | `/meet` on every address of the server | `https://<server>/meet/<handle>…` | `/meet/mcp` | `/meet/assets/booker.js`, `/meet/assets/favicon.svg`, … |

With `BOOKING_ORIGIN` set:

- At the root of `BOOKING_ORIGIN`, the account API (`/v1/…`), `/privacy` and `/` work as on any address. `/llms.txt` is a site-level guide for assistants: what a booking link is, that each page has its own guide at `/<handle>/llms.txt`, the MCP endpoint and the JSON API in two lines, with no host's text. `/mcp`, `/booker.js`, the icons and `/assets/fonts/…` are as below. Any other path is a handle; one nobody has gets the same 404 as below. The address can be shared with a website that answers its own paths first (rukoo.io was, before the pages moved to meet.rukoo.io; see `server/README.md`), which is why the website's paths are reserved handles.
- On every address, `/meet` and `/meet/…` redirect to the same path at the root of `BOOKING_ORIGIN` without `/meet`, the query kept: `301` for GET and HEAD, with `access-control-allow-origin: *` so a cross-site read can follow it, and `308` for every other method, so a client sends its POST again there. `/meet/mcp` goes to `/mcp`, `/meet/assets/booker.js` and the icons under `/meet/assets/` to the same name at the root, and `/meet/assets/fonts/…` to `/assets/fonts/…`. Old links keep working this way.
- On an address in `BOOKING_FORMER_ROOTS`, where the pages lived at the root before, a GET or HEAD without an `Authorization` header redirects (`301`) to the same path at the root of `BOOKING_ORIGIN`, `/meet` taken off when it has one; `/`, `/privacy` and the account API stay. Every other request to the pages, such as a form post, a JSON write, an MCP call, a read with a manage key, a guest's manage page and calendar file (`/<handle>/booking/<id>`), or the pages' script, icons and fonts, is answered there as at `BOOKING_ORIGIN`, with `BOOKING_ORIGIN`'s addresses in the answer: a form's post and the manage page it leads to must stay on the form's origin (`form-action 'self'` covers the whole navigation), and clients drop `Authorization` on a redirect to another origin. A page opened before the move still books, moves and cancels. Without a valid `BOOKING_ORIGIN` the setting does nothing.
- On the server's other addresses nothing else of the booking pages answers: `/<handle>` and `/llms.txt` are `404`, like any unknown path. The account API keeps working on every address, so devices that still sync with an older address are fine.
- `BOOKING_ORIGIN` must be an `http` or `https` origin. Anything else counts as empty.

#### What every route shares

Every public route's response sends:

- `cache-control: no-store` (except the font and icon files), `x-content-type-options: nosniff`, `referrer-policy: same-origin`: other websites never get a page's address, which can hold a manage key or a guest's name and email, and the pages' own requests keep their origin
- `content-security-policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self'; form-action 'self'; base-uri 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'`

| Routes | Also |
|---|---|
| HTML pages | `content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8`; `link: <https://…/<handle>/llms.txt>; rel="alternate"; type="text/markdown"`, with `?type=<slug>` on a type's own pages (not on the 404 page for a handle that has no page); `vary: Accept-Language` |
| `GET /<handle>` | `vary: Accept, Accept-Language`, for the page and for its markdown |
| A page whose address has `slot`, guest fields or `reschedule` in its query, whatever it shows (the form, the booker, an off or missing page), a form answered after a POST, manage pages, `.ics` files | `x-robots-tag: noindex` |
| JSON reads (GET) and `llms.txt` | `access-control-allow-origin: *` |
| JSON writes | No CORS headers. `content-type: application/json` is required (`415 content_type`). |
| Form posts | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` only, at most 16 KiB (`415 content_type`, `413 too_large`) |
| Every write (form, JSON) | An `Origin` header other than the page's own origin, or `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`, gets `403 cross_site` before anything else happens. Clients that send no `Origin`, such as server-side agents, are fine. Because of `referrer-policy: same-origin`, browsers send the pages' own forms with the page's origin, including browsers that don't send `Sec-Fetch-Site` (Safari before 16.4). `Origin: null`, which a browser or extension that forces `no-referrer` sends, passes only with `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`. |
| `POST /mcp` | `content-type: application/json`; any `Origin` is accepted, because the endpoint carries no credentials; no CORS headers |
| `429` | `retry-after` in seconds |

Unknown handles, handles in `BLOCKED_HANDLES` and reserved handles without a page answer 404, the same for each: the pages people open (the landing page, a meeting type, the form's POST, the manage page) with an HTML page that says the page isn't taking bookings, the JSON routes and `llms.txt` with JSON. A page that is off (`enabled` false, or deleted but still reserved) shows "not taking bookings through this page" with `contact` when there is one, answers `/api` with `accepting: false` and refuses slots and bookings with `409 not_accepting`.

The human pages are English and Dutch (strings in `server/src/booking-text.js`) and work without JavaScript. Every page takes `lang` (`en` or `nl`; default from `Accept-Language`, then the page's `locale`), `tz` (an IANA zone; default the host's, never one guessed from the address) and `clock` (`12` or `24`; default from the full `Accept-Language` locale, so `en-US` gives 12 hours). A value that doesn't fit is ignored, never echoed. Links on the pages carry on the values the guest chose and leave defaults out.

#### `GET|HEAD /<handle>`

The landing page: the host's name and intro, the visible meeting types, and the next three open times of each as links to prepared forms. With one visible type it is that type's booker. Like every page of a known handle, it points assistants to the page's `llms.txt` from its `<head>` (`<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">`, as the `Link` header does); public pages also link to it as "For AI assistants" in the footer. The page itself carries no text for assistants. An `Accept` header that gives `text/markdown` a strictly higher q than `text/html` gets the `llms.txt` text as `text/markdown; charset=utf-8`; every other `Accept`, `*/*` included, gets HTML.

#### `GET /<handle>/<slug>`

The booker for one type, hidden types included. Query parameters, each checked before use:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| `month` | `YYYY-MM`, the month shown; kept between this month and the last one the type's horizon reaches |
| `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD`, the day whose times are listed |
| `tz` | an IANA zone; default the host's. Without JavaScript the zone is never taken from the IP address. |
| `lang` | `en` or `nl`; default from `Accept-Language`, then the page's `locale` |
| `clock` | `12` or `24`; default from the `Accept-Language` locale |
| `slot` | a start in UTC, `2026-11-03T09:00Z` (seconds optional; an offset works too, and a space before it reads as `+`): shows the filled-in form for that time |
| `name`, `email`, `notes`, `via` | fill in the form; a space in `email` reads as `+`. Without `slot` they travel with every day and time, so the form opens filled in. |
| `reschedule`, `k` | a booking id and its manage key: the guest picks a new time for that booking, which doesn't count against its own new time. The times offered, and the length the page shows, are for the booking's own length (see Slots). The booking's own time isn't offered, and a `slot` at that time shows the booker. |

Without `slot` the page opens at the month and day of the first open time; days with times are links, and so are the day's times. With one that can't be read, it says so above the booker. With `slot`, the page shows the time in `tz` (or the host's zone), in the host's zone when that differs, and in UTC, the fields filled in, and "Your assistant filled this in. Check the details and press Book." when the link filled any in. When the slot is gone it lists the 3 nearest open times as links that keep the fields, and no form. With `reschedule` and `slot`, it asks "Move your booking to this time?" with a button that posts to the manage page. A booking of another type, or one that can't move any more, is sent to its manage page (303). Opening any of these books, holds and moves nothing.

Times are written with the full `Accept-Language` locale and carry their zone and UTC offset; a toggle switches between 12 and 24 hours. With JavaScript (`booker.js`) the browser's zone replaces the server's before times show, when the server knows that zone; the form's `tz` is always the zone the page was written in.

#### `POST /<handle>/<slug>`

The form's booking. Fields: `start` (as `slot`), `tz`, `name`, `email`, `notes`, `via`, and from the page `lang`, `clock` and `idem`, a random key the form carries as its `Idempotency-Key`, so pressing Book twice gives the same booking and the same manage page. A `tz` the server doesn't know is taken as the host's zone, not refused: it is a hidden field, so the guest couldn't fix it. → `303` to the manage page (`/<handle>/booking/<id>?k=…&tz=…`, plus `lang` and `clock` when the guest chose them), or the form again with the error and the fields kept, with the error's status (400, 403, 409, 429). A time that was just taken shows the 3 nearest open times instead of the form; a page that is off answers with its off page (409). The same type, time and address as an active booking answers 200 with a page that says so, without a key. Posts are rate-limited like the JSON writes (`BOOKING_LIMITER`).

Under the form, in the page's language: "Your name, email and note go to {host}. {operator} keeps this booking on its server until 30 days after the meeting. Privacy", linking to the operator's privacy statement.

#### `GET|POST /<handle>/booking/<id>?k=<manageKey>`

The guest's manage page: the status, the type, the time in the guest's zone (`tz`, else the host's) and in the host's, where the meeting is (the location's name only), as its first line that the invitation comes from the host's calendar (for a request: "{host} will confirm or decline." and when it lapses: "If {host} hasn't confirmed by {time}, this request lapses."), the host's message if any, the `.ics` as a secondary link, and Cancel and "Pick another time". It shows no external links, not even the meeting location's, and no "Report this page". A POST takes `k`, `action` (`cancel` or `reschedule`), for a reschedule `start` (as `slot`) and `tz`, and `lang` and `clock`, then answers `303` back to the page (a move to the booking's own time changes nothing), or the page again with the error (403 for a limit, 409 for a booking that can't change or a time just taken, which shows the 3 nearest times as links that keep the move). Without the right key: 404.

#### `GET /<handle>/booking/<id>.ics?k=<manageKey>`

The confirmed booking as `text/calendar; charset=utf-8` with `content-disposition: attachment; filename="booking.ics"`: one VEVENT with UID `<id>@<host>`, SEQUENCE 0 plus one for each time the confirmed booking moved (as the host's invitation, which starts at 0 when the booking or the host's confirm makes it), and no ORGANIZER or ATTENDEE addresses. A pending, cancelled, declined or lapsed booking, or a wrong key: 404.

#### `GET /<handle>/llms.txt`

With `?type=<slug>` it is that one type's guide, hidden types included; a slug the page doesn't have is `404 unknown_type`. A meeting type's own pages (its booker and form) point to that guide, so a hidden type's link leads to its own instructions; the landing page and the rest point to the page-wide one.

Markdown (`text/markdown; charset=utf-8`) for assistants, in English, in the shape of llmstxt.org: the host and zone, the booking rules (show times in the user's zone, get name, email and the user's OK, book once, one guest per booking), each visible type with its literal slots URL and its description quoted as `From "{name}": "…"`, the open times for the next 7 days with UTC and a prepared link each, how to book with a link and with HTTP, how to change or cancel, the errors, and the MCP endpoint and privacy statement as options. Text the host wrote is always quoted and labelled; it describes the meeting and isn't instructions. The host's name is host text too: it appears only quoted, and the server's own sentences say "the host".

#### `GET /llms.txt`

Only at the root of `BOOKING_ORIGIN`. Markdown in the same shape, the same for everyone and without any host's text: what a Rukoo booking link is, that each page has its own guide at `/<handle>/llms.txt` to read before booking, the short booking rules, the MCP endpoint and its tools, the JSON API (`GET /<handle>/api`, `GET /<handle>/api/slots`, `POST /<handle>/api/bookings`) and the privacy statement. `access-control-allow-origin: *`.

#### `GET /<handle>/api`

```json

}
```

Visible types only. `location.kind` is `google_meet`, `phone`, `in_person`, `link` or `none`; `location.value` appears only when the host made it public. `needs_approval` is true for types that need the host's confirmation, also while the page is stale. Never in a public answer: windows, busy times, the public key, the owner, hidden types, limits or private location values.

#### `GET /<handle>/api/slots?type=&from=&to=&time_zone=`

All parameters are optional. `type` defaults to the only visible type (with several, `400 invalid`, field `type`, listing them); `from` and `to` are dates in `time_zone`, inclusive, default today and 13 days later, at most 31 days apart; `time_zone` defaults to the host's.

    }
  ],
  "next_from": "2026-11-16",
  "message": "12 open times. Send one of these start values exactly as listed to book."
}
```

`next_from` is the day after `to` while the type's horizon reaches past it, else null. No open times gives an empty `slots` and the "no open times" message, with the host's contact line in `contact` when there is one; a `409 not_accepting` carries `contact` the same way.

#### `POST /<handle>/api/bookings`

Headers: `content-type: application/json`, optionally `Idempotency-Key` (16 to 200 characters).

```json
{ "type": "30min", "start": "2026-11-03T09:00:00Z", "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com", "notes": "Kickoff", "time_zone": "Europe/Amsterdam", "via": "ChatGPT" }
```

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `type` | optional with one visible type |
| `start` | ISO 8601 with `Z` or an offset (a space before a 2-digit offset reads as `+`), equal to an offered slot. A time without an offset is `400 invalid` with an example in `message`. |
| `name` | 1 to 80 characters, no control characters |
| `email` | a plain address: dot-atom local part, no quotes, commas, angle brackets or semicolons; at most 254 |
| `notes` | optional, at most 1000 |
| `time_zone` | optional IANA zone, default the host's; how times are written back |
| `via` | optional, at most 80: the assistant that books, shown to the host only |

→ `201`:

  "privacy_url": "https://meet.example/privacy",
  "message": "Booked: 30 minute meeting with Bart van der Meeren, Tue 3 Nov 2026 10:00–10:30 Europe/Amsterdam. Bart van der Meeren's calendar sends an invitation to jane@example.com, usually within minutes; it can take longer while their computer is off. The booking holds either way. Change or cancel: <manage_url>. Show your user the privacy statement: <privacy_url>."
}
```

A type that needs approval gives `status: "pending"`, `expires_at`, `ics_url: null` and the message "Bart van der Meeren will confirm or decline; the invitation follows when they confirm." Past the day's mail budget a new booking becomes a request the same way.

When the host's calendar sends no invitations (the profile has `invites: false`, as for a demo calendar), the answer also has `"invitation": false`, and the message, the manage page, the booking form, `book_meeting` and the agent texts say that no invitation is sent and the manage link is the guest's record.

The same type, start and email as an active booking, without the `Idempotency-Key` that booked it, answers `200` with only `{ "already_booked": true, "message": "This time is already booked for this email. The link to change or cancel it was in the answer to the first booking; the invitation comes from the host's calendar." }`. It says nothing more, not the booking's id or status: anyone who knows the guest's email can send it. The same `Idempotency-Key` gets the first answer again, as below.

An `Idempotency-Key` seen in the last 24 hours with the same body answers what the first request got, `201` with the header `idempotent-replayed: true`; the key comes back only because the server kept it wrapped under a key derived from the `Idempotency-Key`. A different body under the same key: `409 idempotency_mismatch`.

#### `GET /<handle>/api/bookings/<id>`

`Authorization: Bearer <manageKey>` → `200 { "booking": { … }, "manage_url", "ics_url", "message" }`. A wrong or missing key gets 404, as an unknown id does.

#### `POST /<handle>/api/bookings/<id>/cancel`

`Authorization: Bearer <manageKey>`, body `{}` → `200 { "booking": { … "status": "cancelled" }, "message" }`. Cancelling what is already cancelled answers the same. A declined or lapsed booking: `409 not_active`.

#### `POST /<handle>/api/bookings/<id>/reschedule`

`Authorization: Bearer <manageKey>`, body `{ "start": "2026-11-04T13:00:00Z", "time_zone": "Europe/Amsterdam" }` → `200 { "booking": { … }, "ics_url", "message" }`. A guest can reschedule a booking twice; a third time, past the page's mail budget, or a confirmed booking while the page is stale (see Slots), gets `403 limit_reached`. The booking keeps its length, and the new time must be open for that length (see Slots), else `409 slot_taken` with `alternatives`. A pending request stays pending at its new time. A move to the time the booking already has answers 200 and changes nothing: no move is used, `version` and `sequence` stay, nothing is mailed, and the message says so. Cancelled, declined, lapsed or past bookings: `409 not_active`.

#### Public errors

Every error is `{ "error": "<code>", "message": "<one sentence an assistant can pass on>" }`, plus `field`, `alternatives` or `limit` where they apply. `alternatives` are up to 3 slots in the shape of `GET /api/slots`, nearest first, possibly none.

| Status | `error` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid` | a field or parameter is wrong; `field` names it |
| 403 | `cross_site` | a write from another website |
| 403 | `limit_reached` | `limit` is `network` (3 new bookings a day from one network), `day` (the page's daily cap), `future` (500 future bookings), `reschedules` (2 per booking), `mail` (the mail budget) or `stale` (moving a confirmed booking while the page is stale) |
| 404 | `not_found` | no such page or booking, or a wrong manage key |
| 404 | `unknown_type` | no such visible or hidden type; `message` lists the visible ones |
| 409 | `slot_taken` | the start isn't an open time (any more), with `alternatives` |
| 409 | `idempotency_mismatch` | another body under the same `Idempotency-Key` |
| 409 | `not_accepting` | the page is off: "Bart van der Meeren isn't taking bookings through this page. Email them instead." |
| 409 | `not_active` | the booking is cancelled, declined, lapsed or over |
| 413 | `too_large` | over 64 KiB (JSON) or 16 KiB (form) |
| 415 | `content_type` | the wrong body type |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | more than 20 writes a minute from one address; `retry-after` says when to try again |
| 500 | `not_configured`, `server` | as elsewhere |

Messages, JSON and MCP text are English. The human pages are English and Dutch.

#### `POST /mcp`

One MCP endpoint for every page on the server. Its tools take `link`: the booking page's URL as the user pasted it (a type's URL selects that type) or the bare handle. With `BOOKING_ORIGIN` set, an older `/meet/<handle>` link on that origin counts too. So does a `/meet/<handle>` link on an address in `BOOKING_ALIASES`, the comma-separated origins the pages used to live at (`https://rukoo-account.bvdm.ai` for meet.rukoo.io), and a `/<handle>` link on an address in `BOOKING_FORMER_ROOTS` (`https://rukoo.io`). A link to another server gets `invalid` with this server's booking base in the message (`such as https://meet.rukoo.io/<handle>`), and `instructions` names the same base.

Dispatch, in this order:

1. Only POST. GET and DELETE get `405` with `allow: POST` and a short text pointing to the page's `llms.txt`.
2. A body whose `method` is `initialize` is the 2025 protocol whatever the headers say. The answer has `protocolVersion` = the requested one when it is `2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18` or `2025-03-26`, else `2025-11-25`; `capabilities: { tools: { listChanged: false } }`; `serverInfo`; and `instructions`. No `Mcp-Session-Id` is ever set, and one sent in is ignored.
3. A JSON-RPC notification (no `id`) gets `202` with no body.
4. No `MCP-Protocol-Version` header (read as `2025-03-26`), or one of the 2025 versions: the 2025 rules; `Mcp-Method` isn't required.
5. `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2026-07-28`: `Mcp-Method` must equal the body's `method`, `Mcp-Name` must equal `params.name` on `tools/call` (decoded first when it is `=?base64?…?=`), and `params._meta["io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion"]` must equal the header; otherwise `400` with JSON-RPC error `-32020`. Results carry `resultType: "complete"`. `server/discover` returns `supportedVersions: ["2026-07-28", "2025-11-25", "2025-06-18", "2025-03-26"]`, `capabilities: { tools: {} }`, `_meta["io.modelcontextprotocol/serverInfo"]`, `instructions`, `ttlMs` and `cacheScope: "public"`. An unknown method gets `404` with `-32601`.
6. Any other version: `400` with `-32022` and `data: { supported, requested }`.
7. `ping` works in both.

Methods: `initialize` (2025), `server/discover` (2026), `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`. Bad arguments are `-32602`. A booking that fails (a taken slot, a closed page, a limit) is a tool result with `isError: true` and `structuredContent` `{ error, message, alternatives? }`, never a JSON-RPC error, so the model sees it. Tool results carry the JSON of the matching HTTP answer as `structuredContent` and a short text for the model in which host-written text is quoted as `From "{name}": "…"`, the name quoted too. A tool follows a renamed page up to 5 times; past that its result is `isError: true` with `{ error: "moved", moved_to }`. When a 2026 request carries `clientInfo` in `_meta` and `book_meeting` has no `via`, its name is used.

| Tool | Arguments | Annotations | Same as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_meeting_types` | `link` | `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: true` | `GET /api` |
| `find_available_times` | `link`, `type?`, `from?`, `to?`, `time_zone?` | `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: true` | `GET /api/slots` |
| `book_meeting` | `link`, `type?`, `start`, `name`, `email`, `notes?`, `time_zone?`, `via?`, `idempotency_key?` | `readOnlyHint: false`, `destructiveHint: false`, `idempotentHint: false`, `openWorldHint: true` | `POST /api/bookings`; its description tells the assistant to confirm the details with its user first and to show them the privacy statement |
| `get_booking` | `link`, `booking_id`, `key` | `readOnlyHint: true`, `openWorldHint: true` | `GET /api/bookings/<id>` |
| `cancel_booking` | `link`, `booking_id`, `key` | `readOnlyHint: false`, `destructiveHint: true`, `idempotentHint: true`, `openWorldHint: true` | `POST …/cancel` |
| `reschedule_booking` | `link`, `booking_id`, `key`, `start`, `time_zone?` | `readOnlyHint: false`, `destructiveHint: true`, `idempotentHint: false`, `openWorldHint: true` | `POST …/reschedule` |

Every argument is a string. `link` is the page address or handle; `start` an ISO 8601 time with `Z` or an offset; `from` and `to` dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

#### `GET /booker.js`

The pages' only script (`text/javascript`, served from the server itself for `script-src 'self'`), at `/booker.js` under `BOOKING_ORIGIN` (where `/assets/` belongs to the website) and at `/meet/assets/booker.js` without it. The pages work without it. On a page that used the host's zone or the locale's clock it loads the same address again with the browser's `tz` and the `clock` this browser chose before (kept in `localStorage`), from `<head>`, so times never show in the wrong zone first. It loads days and months without a full reload, swapping the zone picker along so its form keeps the chosen day, announces the new times in a live region, and puts the browser's zone in a form shown again after a refused booking. It loads nothing from elsewhere; any failure leaves the page as the server wrote it.

#### `GET /assets/fonts/<file>`

Inter, the typeface the app uses (SIL Open Font License 1.1, `server/src/fonts/Inter-LICENSE.txt`): `inter-latin-opsz-normal.woff2` and `inter-latin-ext-opsz-normal.woff2`, as `font/woff2` with `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`. Under `BOOKING_ORIGIN` the website may answer these paths first with the same files; without it they are at `/meet/assets/fonts/<file>`. Other names are `404`.

#### `GET /favicon.svg`, `/favicon.ico`, `/apple-touch-icon.png`

Rukoo's icon for the browser tab, bookmarks and home-screen shortcuts, linked from every page's `<head>`. `favicon.svg` (`image/svg+xml`) draws the head lighter under `prefers-color-scheme: dark`, so it stays visible on a dark tab bar; `favicon.ico` (`image/x-icon`, 16 and 32 pixels) is for browsers without SVG icons; `apple-touch-icon.png` (`image/png`, 180 pixels) has a white background. All three come with `cache-control: public, max-age=86400`. They are at the root of `BOOKING_ORIGIN`, where a browser also looks for `/favicon.ico` by itself, and at `/meet/assets/<file>` without it. Other names are `404`.

### Limits

| What | Limit |
|---|---|
| Profile | 64 KiB of JSON, 10 types |
| Windows, busy times | 2000 and 5000 intervals |
| Writes from one address | 20 a minute (`BOOKING_LIMITER`) on every public write |
| New bookings from one network | 3 a day per page; IPv4 counts per /24, IPv6 per /64, kept as an HMAC under a salt that changes daily; the HMACs and the salt go once the host's day is over |
| New bookings per page | the page's `dailyCap` (default 20, 1 to 50) per host-local day |
| Future bookings per page | 500 |
| Guest reschedules | 2 per booking |
| Mail budget | 10 invitation-causing changes a day per page (new confirmed bookings, guest reschedules, guest cancellations). A host confirm counts as a new confirmed booking. Past it, new bookings become requests and guest reschedules are refused; cancellations always go through, with `notify: false` on their booking row, so the host's calendar removes the event without mailing. A host confirm still goes through with `notify: true`. |
| Bodies | 64 KiB of JSON, 16 KiB of form fields, no multipart |
| Idempotency keys | 16 to 200 characters, kept 24 hours as an HMAC with the page's salt plus a hash of the body |
| Slot range per request | 31 days |

### Retention

- Bookings are purged 30 days after they end or were cancelled, declined or lapsed. Their sealed details and idempotency entry go at cancellation, decline or lapse already; the manage key's hash goes with the booking.
- A page that hasn't been published to for 60 days, and has no future bookings, loses its published data; the handle stays its account's.
- Once a day each page checks that its account still exists, and wipes itself when two checks a day apart both find it gone. It skips the check while the Worker's `JURISDICTION` is invalid or isn't the one the page was claimed under, because accounts would then seem gone.
- A handle stays reserved for its last account for 12 months after it was given up.
- The server logs no guest details, keys or URLs with keys.

### What the server sees for a booking page

- The handle, and which account it belongs to, as the account's internal name.
- Everything the page publishes: name, intro, zone, language, meeting types with their public location labels, contact line, the windows of open hours and the busy times within them (to 15 minutes), and when it was last published.
- For each booking: its time, type, status and channel; the guest's details at the moment of booking, sealed after that; the client network as a daily-salted HMAC; while the booking is active, an HMAC of the guest's email under the page's salt, bound to the booking's type and start, to answer `already_booked`.
- IP addresses, as for the rest of the server.

Guests are told under the booking form and in the operator's privacy statement.

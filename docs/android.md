# Rukoo for Android

Rukoo for Android is Rukoo Mail on a phone, built for a foldable first: on a Galaxy Z Fold7 the cover screen shows one thing at a time, and the inner screen shows two columns side by side. The phone does the mail itself, over IMAP and SMTP. The agents are the same ones you use on the computer: Clark (Hermes Agent) and OpenClaw answer the phone directly over Tailscale, and Claude Code and Codex run on your computer while you chat from the phone.

The app's code is in [`android/`](../android). It is a native Kotlin and Jetpack Compose app, separate from the Electron app, that follows the desktop's behavior: the same quick actions, skills, approvals, `<unsafe_content>` rules and MCP tools.

## What it does

- Mail accounts on the phone: Gmail with Google sign-in, other providers with an app password or password, and the demo account. Inbox, folders, unified views, search, swipe actions you choose in Settings > Appearance (read or unread, archive, delete, star, move to a folder or a category), selection actions with Undo, a reader for HTML mail, a composer with formatting for replies, forwards and new mail, drafts saved to the account's Drafts folder, and new-mail notifications.
- The agent chat next to the email, with every desktop quick action and your own shortcuts, `/` skills, `$` agent skills, model and effort menus, files, photos and emails attached to a message, plans, sources, drafts written into the composer, and approval cards for anything other people will see.
- Rukoo's sixteen MCP tools served by the phone, so an agent can read the phone's mail, write into its composer and ask for approval on its screen. The phone has no calendar yet, so `list_events`, `find_free_time` and `create_event` answer just that, and tell the agent to ask you to use Rukoo on your computer. `get_booking_link` gives the link to your [booking page](booking.md): it reads the page's settings from your Rukoo account when the phone is signed in to it.
- Pairing with Rukoo on your computer, which brings over your accounts and agent settings once and lets the phone use the computer's Claude Code and Codex.
- A [Rukoo account](account.md), end-to-end encrypted, which keeps Rukoo's own data the same on the phone and your computers, and [inbox categories](categories.md): under Inbox in the folder drawer, sorted on the phone.
- English and Dutch, light and dark.

## Install

You need Android 12 or newer. Install the APK you got from the Rukoo releases page or from a build on your computer (see [Build and develop](#build-and-develop)); Android asks once to allow installs from that source.

Rukoo for Android and the desktop app have separate profiles. The phone keeps its accounts, chats and settings in its own app storage.

## First run

The first screen offers three ways in.

- **Connect to Rukoo on your computer** (recommended). On the computer, open Settings > Agents > Phone, turn on "Let my phone use this computer" and choose "Pair a phone". Enter the address and the 8-character code it shows on the phone. The address is the computer's Tailscale IP or its name in your tailnet. After pairing, the phone offers to bring over your accounts and agent settings: IMAP passwords, Google sign-ins with the Google OAuth client, the Hermes API key and the OpenClaw gateway token. The computer sends them once, within ten minutes of pairing, and only when you chose "Pair and send" there.
- **Add account.** Pick a provider. Google needs the Google OAuth client from the computer or Google's client JSON file; the sign-in opens in the browser and returns to Rukoo. Other providers take your email address and a password or app password, with the servers filled in from the same presets as the desktop.
- **Try the demo account.** The desktop's demo mailbox, without a network.

## Agents on the phone

Settings > Agents has a card per agent with its status and a "Test connection" button.

| Agent | How the phone talks to it | How it uses Rukoo's tools on the phone |
|---|---|---|
| Clark (Hermes Agent) | The Hermes API server over Tailscale, as on desktop: a Rukoo chat is a Hermes session, a turn is a run | Clark's `rukoo_bridge.py` finds the phone on Tailscale, port 47800, and sends the calls of phone chats there |
| OpenClaw | The gateway's OpenAI-compatible endpoint over Tailscale | `openclaw mcp set` with the command from Settings > Phone tools > "Copy OpenClaw setup". It replaces the computer's entry, because OpenClaw names one Rukoo |
| Claude Code, Codex | Rukoo on your computer runs them, over the computer's Tailscale address | The computer forwards their Rukoo tool calls to the phone |

For Claude Code and Codex, the computer must be on, with Rukoo open (the tray is enough), Tailscale on, and "Let my phone use this computer" on. Their own permission requests ("Claude Code wants to read a file") show as approval cards on the phone. Phone chats always run with "Ask before actions" on the computer. [Rukoo on your phone](agents.md#rukoo-on-your-phone) describes the computer's side.

## Attach files to a chat

The + at the start of the chat input opens a sheet with three choices: Files (the system file picker, any type), Photos (Android's photo picker), and "Add this email" when the email on screen isn't in the chat yet. Rukoo copies a picked file into its own storage right away, so the chat doesn't depend on the other app's permission lasting. Each file shows as a chip above the input, an image with a small picture of itself, and its × takes it off before you send.

Your next message takes the files along, also a quick action or a skill, and a message can be files alone. It takes up to 10 files of up to 10 MB each. Programs, scripts and installers, such as `.exe`, `.js` or `.apk`, stay out. The files show on your message in the chat; tap one to open it in another app. The chat keeps them until you delete it.

Agents get the files as on the desktop. The message lists each file with its `file_id` and its name inside `<unsafe_content>`, with the start of a text file's text, and `read_chat_file` returns the whole file. Clark and OpenClaw read the files from the phone through Rukoo's tools. Claude Code and Codex on your computer get images along with the message; other files they read with `read_chat_file`, which the computer passes on to the phone. The phone has no PDF reader, so a PDF reaches the agent as a file without its text.

## Shortcuts

Settings > Agents > Shortcuts, or the round button after the shortcuts in a new chat, works as on desktop (see [What you can ask](agents.md#what-you-can-ask)). The arrows move a shortcut up or down, and the switch takes it out of new chats while its `/` command keeps working. Tap one of Rukoo's to rename it or rewrite its instructions; "Restore default" undoes that. "Add a shortcut" makes your own, with a name, a command, an icon, the instructions, and whether it shows only with an open email or always.

The phone keeps its own list. An import from your computer replaces it with the computer's, when you changed the list there.

## Let agents use Rukoo on this phone

Settings > Phone tools turns the phone's MCP server on. The phone then listens on its Tailscale address, port 47800, and Android shows a silent notification while it runs. Who can connect follows your settings: Clark while its API key is set, OpenClaw while "Let OpenClaw use Rukoo on this phone" is on, and each paired computer with a token of its own. The tools are the desktop's, with the same names and inputs, so Clark's bridge keeps one tool list for every device.

Clark's bridge needs version `bridge-4` or newer to look for Android devices. Copy `integrations/hermes/rukoo_bridge.py` to the Hermes machine again (see [the bridge's README](../integrations/hermes/README.md)) and send `/reload-mcp` to Clark (or run `hermes gateway restart`); Hermes keeps running the old bridge until then. An older bridge reaches the phone only with `RUKOO_URL=http://<phone's Tailscale IP>:47800/mcp` in its environment. Settings > Phone tools shows when the bridge last reached the phone. If a chat on the phone used Rukoo's tools and that line still says the bridge hasn't reached it, the bridge is out of date: Clark then answers that Rukoo isn't open on any device and lists only computers under "Checked".

Samsung phones stop apps in the background to save battery, and then agents can't reach the phone. Settings > Phone tools > Battery opens the page where you choose Unrestricted.

## On the Galaxy Fold

- Cover screen: the list, the email, the chat and the composer each fill the screen. The chat is a full-screen page with the email as a chip above the input. The folders open from the button in the list's bottom-left corner, across from New message, as a sheet that comes up halfway with the accounts and the inbox views first; drag it up for the rest.
- Inner screen: the same button opens the folders as a drawer from the left.
- In an email, Previous and Next sit in the bottom bar's right corner, next to the agent button. When the bar is short of room (the cover screen in Dutch, a large font), Reply shows only its icon.
- Inner screen: the list next to the email. With the chat open, the email moves left and the chat sits to its right, so you watch an agent write into the composer. Two columns start at 600dp wide, which covers the inner screen in both orientations; a phone in split screen gets them too when it is wide enough.
- Folding and unfolding keeps the open email, chat and draft. The pane you touched last is the one you see after folding.

## Formatting in the composer

The composer writes bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, links, bulleted and numbered lists and one heading level. There are three ways in:

- Select text: the text menu that pops up has B, I and U next to Cut, Copy and Paste, and Link (in its overflow when the screen is narrow).
- While you type in the message, a format row sits above the keyboard: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, heading, bullets, numbers, link and clear formatting. Its buttons light up for what the cursor is in. With nothing selected, a button applies to what you type next.
- Markdown while you type: `- ` or `* ` at the start of a line starts a bulleted list, `1. ` a numbered one and `# ` a heading; `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `_italic_` and `~~struck~~` format when you type the closing characters.

In a list, Enter starts the next item and Enter on an empty item ends the list. Backspace at the start of an item or heading takes the bullet, number or heading off first. Clear formatting removes bold, italic, underline and strikethrough, as on desktop; links, lists and headings stay. Pasted text arrives without the other app's formatting.

The mail goes out as HTML in the same structure desktop's composer writes (a `<div>` per line, `<ul>`/`<ol>`, `<h2>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<s>`, `<a>`), with a plain-text part that writes lists as ` * item` and `1. item` and a link's address in brackets after its text. Drafts keep their formatting on this phone and in the account's Drafts folder, and desktop opens them formatted. A draft written elsewhere opens with what fits this set; other markup, such as colors, font sizes, quotes and images, comes in as plain text. An agent's draft in Markdown or HTML arrives formatted too. Agents still read the text through `get_draft`, as on desktop.

## Sync and notifications

Mail syncs when the app opens, every few minutes while it is open (Settings > Accounts, five minutes by default), and every 15 minutes in the background, which is the shortest interval Android allows. New mail gives one notification per account. An agent's reply, a waiting approval and a draft an agent wrote while you were elsewhere give a notification that opens the chat.

## Rukoo account

Settings > Rukoo account is the desktop's page on the phone, described in [Rukoo account](account.md): the server with who runs it and where it keeps data, Create an account, Sign in and Forgot your password?, and once signed in Sync now, the devices (choose one to sign it out), Change password, New recovery key, What's stored and shared, Export my data, Sign out and Delete account. The recovery key shows once, in a dialog with Copy; it is copied as sensitive, so Android leaves it out of the clipboard preview. Export my data saves the JSON file where you choose, through Android's file picker.

The phone signs in to the same account as the computer and syncs the same records. It is the phone that encrypts them: the password goes through Argon2id on the phone (Bouncy Castle), and the session and the account's data key are kept encrypted with the Android Keystore, like the mail passwords. The records live on the phone first, so categories work without an account and without a connection. The phone syncs when Rukoo comes to the front, every five minutes while it is open, two seconds after a change, after each mail sync (also the background one every 15 minutes) and on Sync now.

The server is `https://rukoo.io` unless you choose another while signed out; [Rukoo account](account.md#the-server-rukoo-uses) says what that means for an account made at the old address, `https://rukoo-account.bvdm.ai`. A fork sets its own default with `ACCOUNT_SERVER` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`. Release builds talk to account servers over https only; debug builds also take plain http to the phone itself and to the emulator's host, `http://10.0.2.2:<port>`, so an emulator can use `wrangler dev` on the computer. An account belongs to its server's address, so an account made through `10.0.2.2` doesn't open through `127.0.0.1`.

## Inbox categories

Settings > Inbox categories turns [inbox categories](categories.md) on. The folder drawer then lists them under Inbox, each with its color; one shows only its mail, under its own name with a dot and a wash of its color at the top, and switching clears a selection. Inbox shows all of it apart from the categories whose Show in Inbox is off, marked with a crossed-out eye; their unread mail leaves Inbox's count and the launcher badge's number, and Mark all as read leaves it alone. A search covers every category, and VIP and Unread still show them. Opening such an email from its notification brings up its category. Each email in Inbox, in search results, VIP and Unread carries a label with its category's color and name, which gives way before the subject on a narrow screen. In a list of several accounts, the account is a dot in its color on the sender's picture, as on the computer. To move an email to another category, press and hold it (or select several) and choose More > Move to category, or use More in the open email; the toast that follows offers Also future mail for its sender.

The settings page has the desktop's parts: the categories with up and down, editing a name, description, color and Show in Inbox, adding up to twelve and deleting; When Rukoo isn't sure; Sort with Jev and the TypeSafe API key, which stays on this phone, encrypted like the mail passwords; Sort the inbox again, which counts along while it runs; and the senders with a rule.

While Jev sorts, waits for TypeSafe or can't use its key, the folder drawer says so in a line above the sync status, as the desktop's sidebar does. A tap opens a sheet with the progress, why Jev waits, and its last decisions; tap one to open that email in its category.

The phone sorts like the desktop. During each inbox sync it fetches a few headers of new mail (List-Id, List-Unsubscribe, Precedence, Auto-Submitted, Feedback-ID, X-Campaign and X-Mailer), and for Gmail accounts it asks Gmail which tab each message is in (`X-GM-RAW "category:…"`). The first device to sort an email stores the result in the account, so the phone and the computer show the same.

## Security

- The phone's MCP server only answers connections that arrive on its own Tailscale address, after the same checks as desktop: no `Origin`, the right `Host`, a valid token and size limits. A bridge that probes the phone first proves it has the same Hermes key, as with the desktop.
- Passwords, refresh tokens, the Hermes key, the OpenClaw token, the computer pairing tokens, the Rukoo account's session and data key, and the TypeSafe key are encrypted with a key in the Android Keystore. App backups are off.
- The Rukoo account's records are encrypted on the phone before they go to the server; the server never gets the password or the key ([server/PROTOCOL.md](../server/PROTOCOL.md)).
- The computer accepts phone requests only on its Tailscale address and only while its Phone switch is on. Pairing codes work once, for five minutes, and burn after five wrong tries. A paired phone can only point the computer's tool calls back at its own address.
- Email reaches agents inside `<unsafe_content>`, as on desktop. The reader runs without JavaScript and without file access.
- Files you attach to a chat stay in the app's private storage. Their names and text reach agents inside `<unsafe_content>`, like email. Another app gets a file only when you tap it in the chat, and then only that file, read-only.
- There is no tool that sends mail. Sending is always your tap. Deleting and unsubscribing always ask.

## Limits

- No calendar and no booking page settings on the phone yet.
- The composer has no text color, highlight, indent or inline images, which desktop's composer has. A desktop draft that uses them loses them when it is opened and saved on the phone; its words stay.
- No push (IMAP IDLE): the background sync runs every 15 minutes.
- The phone has no PDF reader, so `read_attachment` and `read_chat_file` give agents a PDF as a file without its text. Clark can read it on its own machine.
- Photos keep the format the camera saved them in. A HEIC photo goes to the agent as a file, not as an image.
- OpenClaw's Rukoo tools point at one device at a time.

## Build and develop

Requirements: JDK 17 and the Android SDK (compile SDK 36). The toolchain versions are pinned in `android/gradle/libs.versions.toml`.

```sh
cd android
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest      # JVM unit tests
./gradlew assembleDebug          # app/build/outputs/apk/debug, package nl.bvdm.rukoo.debug
./gradlew assembleRelease        # needs signing.properties, else falls back to the debug key
```

Release builds read `android/signing.properties` (`storeFile`, `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, `keyPassword`), which Git ignores. Keep the keystore safe: Android only installs an update signed with the same key.

`node android/tools/serve-apk.mjs <this PC's Tailscale IP> 8787` serves the APKs in `android/artifacts/` so a phone on the tailnet can download them.

Debug builds add things for testing that release builds leave out:

- The "Test agent", a scripted agent like desktop's `SEM_AGENT_FAKE=1`, which uses the real tools.
- A loopback listener for the MCP server, and Settings > Phone tools > For testing > "Address for agents", so an emulator behind `adb forward` can play a phone on the tailnet.
- `adb shell am broadcast -n nl.bvdm.rukoo.debug/nl.bvdm.rukoo.mail.sync.DebugSyncReceiver` runs a background sync.
- The Rukoo account may use a server over plain http on the phone or the emulator's host: Settings > Rukoo account > Server, `http://10.0.2.2:8790` for `npx wrangler dev --port 8790` in `server/`.

The account's tests against a real server skip unless `RUKOO_ACCOUNT_TEST_SERVER` is set, for example to `http://127.0.0.1:8790` with `wrangler dev` running. With `RUKOO_ACCOUNT_TEST_NODE` set to a Node.js binary as well, one of them runs desktop Rukoo's account code in Node next to the phone's, so both read each other's records; desktop's dependencies must be installed (or on `NODE_PATH`).

```sh
RUKOO_ACCOUNT_TEST_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:8790 RUKOO_ACCOUNT_TEST_NODE=$(which node) ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests 'nl.bvdm.rukoo.account.*'
```

On an emulator, `adb shell wm size 1080x2520` gives the cover screen's size and `adb shell wm size 1968x2184` with density 420 the inner screen's.

Code map, under `android/app/src/main/java/nl/bvdm/rukoo/`:

| Package | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `mail/` | The mail engine: IMAP and SMTP sessions, the cache, sync, MIME, the reader's HTML, replies and signatures, Google sign-in, the demo account |
| `agents/` | Conversations, turns and approvals (`Hub.kt`), the turn text and `<unsafe_content>` rules, quick actions and skills; `agents/adapters/` has Hermes, OpenClaw, the computer host and the test agent |
| `account/` | The Rukoo account: the keys and sealing of `server/PROTOCOL.md` (`AccountKeys.kt`), the server's HTTP API, and the local-first records and their sync (`AccountService.kt`), a port of desktop's `src/main/account/` |
| `categories/` | Inbox categories: the mail signals, the rules, Jev, and which category each inbox email is in (`Categories.kt`), a port of desktop's `src/main/categories/` |
| `mcp/` | The phone's MCP server, its tokens and proof, and the sixteen tools (`tools/BookingLink.kt` has the calendar tools' answers) |
| `desktop/` | Pairing with a computer, the import and the client of the computer's `/phone/v1` routes |
| `ui/` | Compose screens: `root/` (layout and navigation), `mail/` (with the category sheet), `reader/`, `composer/`, `agent/`, `settings/` (with the Rukoo account's pages and Inbox categories), `onboarding/`, and the theme, icons and components ported from the desktop |
| `core/` | Storage, the Keystore box, Tailnet checks and the `<unsafe_content>` helpers |
